The goal is to learn how to produce multiple images for inclusion in a single WW problem.

Tool chain

LaTeX including TikZ produces pdf
ImageMagik: pdf -> image formats
The LaTeX files are based on a Jinja template
A Python file controls the Jinja template
make file controls the whole she bang

Not for now (real overkill) data stored in JSON or YAML file.
